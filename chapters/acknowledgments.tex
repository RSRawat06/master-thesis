\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\start{M}{y first}  thank you goes to my parents,
Laura and Carlo, who have always encouraged me to follow my
dreams and my passions. They have supported me during my whole life, especially during these five years at the Politecnico: They have always decided to sacrifice something of theirs to make my life better. Among other things, I would like to especially thank them
as they allowed me to study at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, one of the greatest
experiences of my life.\\
I love you.

I would like to thank Prof. Stefano Zanero, Prof. Lorenzo Cavallaro and Prof.
Federico Maggi
for helping me throughout my research efforts. They are the most professional
and passionate professors and researchers I have ever met, and it was a true pleasure
to work together. A special thank you to Prof. Stefano Zanero who has allowed me
to go as a visiting student to the Royal Holloway University of London, and to
Prof. Lorenzo Cavallaro who hosted me and made me feel more than welcome.

I would also like to thank my friends, who have supported me, and the people at the
NECST Lab, where I spent endless hours working with them. It is a really nice
environment for research, where labor and fun are harmonically mixed.
