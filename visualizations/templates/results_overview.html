			<p>
				Phoenix is a malicious domain classifier that collects passive DNS data and tries to classify the domains and
				cluster the eventual botnets. At the moment we are at an early development stage. Stefano Schiavoni (Google),
				was able to implement the classifier and run it against the data he collected during his master thesis period and
				to perform a few tests that confirmed the goodness of the model.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the data is crunched we have a list of domains along with some useful informations:
			</p>
			<ul class="disc">
				<li>DGA or non-DGA label;</li>
				<li>the eventual cluster it belongs to;</li>
				<li>the history of its DNS requests and replies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Given this huge and precious amount of data we aim at producing two main services:
			</p>
			<ul class="disc">
				<li>a set of visualization tools to better investigate a single domain's data;</li>
				<li>a set of APIs to retrieve the data Phoenix was able to produce.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We shall explain these two features in the next paragraphs.

			<h3>Data, visualized</h3>
			<p>
				We want to produce a set of visualization tools aiming at making an analyst's work faster and easier. More specifically:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Maps</dt>
				<dd>To instantaneously get an idea of where the botmasters had located their machines.</dd>
				<dt>Timeline</dt>
				<dd>To instantaneously get an idea of the time range a domain has been used for communication purposes.</dd>
				<dt>Area Charts</dt>
				<dd>To visualize the botnet communication activity toward a specific domain over time.</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>JSON friendly</h3>
			<p>
				We aim at making all the data displayed in every results page retrievable via HTML GET requests. The data
				can be downloaded both in <code>JSON</code> and <code>.csv</code> format. The APIs section explains thoroughly
				how to retrieve the required data.
