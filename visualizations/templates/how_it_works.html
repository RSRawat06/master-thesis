			Phoenix is a system to classify malicious domains being used for communication between
			botnets C&amp;C and infected machines. It achieves its goal in three subsequent steps (3,4,5 in the side figure).
		</p>
		<h4>AGD Filtering</h4>
		<p>
			A list of malicious domains and its related DNS top-level traffic are fed
			to the AGD Filtering module, which clusters the dataset into two groups: Domains that are
			likely to be automatically generated (AGDs) and those that are not. This is achieved by
			computing a set of linguistic features that should be able to distinguish between the two above mentioned classes.
		</p>
		<h4>AGD Clustering</h4>
		<p>
			The list of AGDs generated by the previous step is fed into the AGD Clustering module.
			Its goal is to group together malicious domains on the basis of which IPs they resolve to,
			IPs that possibly identify the different C&amp;C employed over time.

		<h4>DGA Fingerprinting</h4>
		<p>This last module aims at extracting the following five cluster features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C&amp;C Servers Addresses</li>
			<li>Chosen Prefix Length Range</li>
			<li>Chosen Prefix Character Set</li>
			<li>Chosen Prefix Numerical Characters Ratio</li>
			<li>Public Suffix Set</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These features will be then used to label previously unseen domains whether belonging
			to one of these clusters (i.e. botnet) or not.
